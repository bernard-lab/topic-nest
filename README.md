### Description
TopicNest is a web application designed to facilitate the creation, discussion, and management of topics. Developed as a learning project, it demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can create new topics, read and explore existing ones, update topic details, and delete topics they no longer need. The project aims to provide a practical example of how CRUD methods can be effectively utilized in web development.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
